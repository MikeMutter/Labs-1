# CICSpwn
## Description  
CICSpwn is a tool to pentest CICS Transaction servers on z/OS.

## Features    
* Get general information about CICS and the underlying z/OS  
  * List available IBM supplied transactions
  * Get active sessions and userids
  * Get path (HLQ) of files and libraries
  * Check if CICS is using RACF/ACF2/TopSecret   
* Read files created by the application 
* Enables CECI and CEMT if they are RACF protected
* Remotely execute code using Spoolopen and TDqueue
* Checks security settings on z/OS
## Usage
```
$python cicspwn.py -h

CicsPwn: a tool to pentest CICS transaction servers on z/OS

positional arguments:
  IP                    The z/OS Mainframe IP or Hostname
  PORT                  CICS/VTAM server Port

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a APPLID, --applid APPLID
                        CICS ApplID on VTAM, default is CICS

General information:
  -A, --all             Gather all information about a CICS Transaction Server
  -i, --info            Gather basic information about a CICS region
  -u, --userids         Scrape userids found in different menus
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Specify a pattern of a files/transaction/tsqueue to
                        get (default is "*")
  -q, --quiet           Remove Trailing and journal before performing any
                        action
  --ceci CECI           CECI new transaction name. Result of -i option.
  --cemt CEMT           CEMT new transaction name. Result of -i option.
  --bypass              if CEDA is available, it copies CEMT and CECI to new

  -b OLD_TRAN           if CEDA is available, it copies OLD_TRAN to NEW TRAN
                        (-n option) to bypass RACF. if no NEW TRAN is
                        specified, CICSpwn chooses an IBM supplied transaction
                        always available
  -n NEW_TRAN           if CEDA is available, it copies OLD_TRAN (-b) to NEW

  --add-item TSQUEUE_ADD
                        Add an item (--num) to TSqueue. if NUM exists, updates

  -g SURROGAT_USER      Checks wether you can impersonate another user when
                        submitting a job

## Available shell payloads
* **Reverse_tso**: spawns a reverse tso shell to the host specified by --lhost ip:port option.
* **direct_tso**: same as reverse_tso but binds the shell to --port option
* **reverse_unix**: spawns a reverse unix shell to the host specified by --lhost ip:port option.
* **direct_unix**: same as reverse_unix but binds the shell to --port option
* **ftp**: connects to a remote ftp server specified by --lhost ip:port and executes commands specified in file --ftp-cmds
* **reverse_rexx**: writes a dropper to disk that fetches a rexx payload  from --lhost ip:port and executes it in memory. The listener is handled by CICSpwn. The only constraint is that the rexx file must not contain labels or continuation lines
* **custom**: sends a custom JCL specified by --jcl option
* **dummy**: executes ftp to --lhost ip:port to make sure reverse connection is possible
