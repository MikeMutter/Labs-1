Part 3 - Copy/Paste File from Linux to EvilMF
EASY
 - Type =3.4 in command line, hit enter

 - In command line type 's ACEE'
 - If necessary type 'res' to clear any messages
 - In terminal cat the file 'acee.rx'
 - highlight the output and copy (CTRL + SHIFT + C)

Part 5 - Edit REXX to display ACEEFLG01
- In command line type =3.4 hit enter
- In Dsname enter '<userid>.REXXLIB' hit enter
- In command column enter 'E' hit enter
- In command column next to ACEE enter 'E' hit enter
